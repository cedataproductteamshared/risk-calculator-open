          What does the calculator estimate?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The calculator provides an estimate of your risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years. This calculator is based on a largestudy of over 40,000 people with cardiovascular disease. Your risk is only an estimate – other factors about your health, your diet and exercise patterns, and your treatments may raise or lower your risk. You may already be on some therapies that lower your risk of heart disease. In this case, the calculator shows your risk without any treatments, then shows how your risk is already being lowered by the therapies you are taking.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How do I interpret this number?
        </h4>
        <p>
          If your risk score is 20%, the calculator estimates that 20 out of 100 people like you will have a heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death in the next 10 years.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What can I do to lower my risk of stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The calculator already shows you some things you can do to lower your risk. You may or may not be eligible for these therapies- some of these should not be used in combination with other medications or in people with certain medical conditions. Make sure to talk to your doctor about what treatments you are eligible for.
        </p>
        These are explained below:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>
              Control your LDL cholesterol:
            </b>
             For people with cardiovascular disease, the guidelines recommend a LDL cholesterol of 70 mg/dL or lower. High-intensity statins are the most effective way to do this and lower your risk of heart disease. Two statins: rosuvastatin (20 mg or higher) and atorvastatin (40 mg or higher) are considered “high intensity” and are recommended by guidelines for people with cardiovascular disease.
            <br />
            <br />
            When someone cannot tolerate a statin or who has LDL over 70 on a statin, ezetimibe can be added to statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a non-statin that lowers LDL cholesterol and is very well tolerated. After ezetimibe, injectable medications called PCSK9 inhibitors can be used to further lower LDL cholesterol and lower risk of heart disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Take an antiplatelet medication:
            </b>
             All people with cardiovascular disease should be on at least one medication to block platelets and help prevent heart attacks and strokes. Talk to your doctor about the best option for you- in many people this can be 81 mg of Aspirin. Others, for example those with recent stents in heart arteries, recent strokes or heart attacks, or peripheral artery disease may lower their risk further with a different anti-platelet medication such as clopidogrel (brand name Plavix), ticagrelor (brand name Brillinta), or prasugrel (brand name Effient).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Consider a blood thinner:
            </b>
             In addition to medications to block platelets, some patients may benefit from a low dose blood thinner to further help prevent clots called rivaroxaban (2.5 mg). This includes people with peripheral arterial disease and others who are at high-risk of heart attack. The dose is approved by the FDA. Because it is a blood thinner, people who take this medication are at higher risk of bleeding. Your doctor can help you evaluate your risk of bleeding and whether you are eligible for this therapy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              If you have type 2 diabetes, start a new medication
            </b>
             (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP1 receptor agonist): Two different classes of medications are available that help lower the risk of cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes. This includes SGLT2 Inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists. These are not insulin therapies and can help lower your hemoglobin A1c in addition to giving you extra protection against heart disease. Within the classes of medications, not all have the same benefit or safety profile. Some are given as weekly or daily injections while others are in pill forms. Ask your doctor about what may be a good choice for you.

              Control your blood pressure!
            </b>
             Blood pressure control is one of the most important ways to lower your risk of stroke, heart attack, and other diseases such as kidney disease and heart failure. Current guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal of &lt;130 (top number) and &lt;80 (bottom number) for most people with cardiovascular disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Don’t smoke!
            </b>
             It’s never too late to quit smoking. If you smoke, medication therapies are available to help you quit. Other ways to increase your success include nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, lozenges). Call 1-800-QUIT-NOW for more information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Exercise!
            </b>
             Current guidelines recommend at least 75 minutes of high intensity exercise (like running or aerobics) or 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (like a bike ride or power walk) per week. One way to know if you’re doing moderate intensity exercise is how you feel- you should be able to speak but too winded to sing. If you are able to speak but only in short bursts, you’re probably doing high intensity exercise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Eat well!
            </b>
             Avoid trans fats, saturated fats, and added sugars. Focus on whole grains, vegetables, and lean meats, especially fish. A Mediterranean diet withlean meats, fish, olive oil, nuts, fruits, and vegetables has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease.
